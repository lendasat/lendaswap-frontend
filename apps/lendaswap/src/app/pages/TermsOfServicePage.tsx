              2. Service Description
            </h2>
            <p>
              LendaSwap provides an atomic swap service that enables users to
              exchange Bitcoin (BTC) with Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) and other
              tokens across multiple blockchain networks, including but not
              limited to Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              When a user wishes to acquire BTC using tokens on Ethereum,
              Polygon, or other supported networks, the deposited funds are
              first converted to wBTC through decentralized exchanges (such as
              Uniswap), and then atomically swapped to BTC, which is sent to the
              user&apos;s specified target address.

            </h2>
            <p>
              In the event that a swap cannot be completed or requires a refund,
              users will receive their initial deposited asset back to their
              original address. For swaps initiated from Ethereum, Polygon, or
              other EVM-compatible networks to BTC, please note that:

              participating in swaps from EVM-compatible networks (Ethereum,

              wBTC as part of the swap process.
